### Added
- BREAKING CHANGE: added new Admin middleware used instead of Auth middleware, for redirects to work properly; All other packages will need to use this middleware from now on;
- How to use Password Reset functionality in README.md

### Fixed
- Error views used AdminLTE and had menus, but were also used as the main application error pages. This could become a security issue if the admin isn't careful to shut down registration.
- /login is no longer redirected to /admin/login
- Backpack/Base no longer uses any routes outside the /admin/ prefix in order not to conflict with any catch-all routes (as developers will probably use with PageManager).

- routes.php file - routes are now defined in the BaseServiceProvider, so the package can be easily dropped on top of a Laravel application folder;

## [0.3.0] - 2016-03-04

### Fixed
- Changed folder structure to resemble Laravel's folder structure: Http folder is now inside an /app/ folder.


## [0.2.8] - 2016-03-01

### Fixed

## [0.2.7] - 2016-02-25

### Fixed
- Renamed the sections in admin layout to be friendlier to use and more extensible.
- All routes now use the /admin/ prefix, even the admin authentication. This separates BackPack completely from the main application and allows it to have a different auth for users, if needed.
