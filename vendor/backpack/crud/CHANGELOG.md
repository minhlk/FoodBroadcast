- CRUD Alias for handling the routes.

That, of course, if you define 'CRUD' => 'Dick\CRUD\CrudServiceProvider' in your config/app.php file, under 'aliases'.


## [0.8.0] - 2015-09-09

### Added
- CRUD Details Row functionality: if enabled, it will show a + sign for each row. When clicked, an AJAX call will return the showDetailsRow() method on the controller and place it in a row right below the current one; Currently that method just dumps the entry; But hey, it works.
